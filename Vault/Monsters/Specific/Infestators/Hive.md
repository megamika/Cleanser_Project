A hive is a one central entity which controlls all the [[Infestators]] in the [[Drylands]]. If he is alive the plagues would never stop. His intellegence get's better over time and he can strategize and plan. He purpusefully retreated after [[1st Gen Cleaners]] have overpowered his [[Infestators]] during the [[First plague]]. If you destroy the central Hive, you will stop the [[Plague]].
