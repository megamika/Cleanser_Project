A lone humanoid creature. Prefers to fight alone since this is when it can utilize it's agility at it's fullest. Really good at doging attacks, but has pretty low stamina and it will be vulnerable when it takes it's breath back. His attacks are very quick and precize and it is a really quick creature. It also really REALLY doesn't like help, so it will attempt to kill all of the creatures that get in his way.

## Abilities

Slash - a quick and precize slash. Drains some stamina

Lounge - a medium ranged lounge. Drains a medium amount of stamina.

Shadow - an ability that allows him to blend in with the forest and dissapear completely. Usually followed up with a Lounge from behind. The cycle will be repeated 2-4 times. Stamina is immediately depleted after that attack.
