## Generally
A hive is a one central entity which controlls all the [[Infestators]] in the [[Drylands]]. If he is alive the plagues would never stop. His intellegence get's better over time and he can strategize and plan. He purpusefully retreated after [[1st Gen Cleaners]] have overpowered his [[Infestators]] during the [[First plague]]. If you destroy the central Hive, you will stop the [[Plague]].

## The entity

If the hive itself feels endangered it will take up a powerful humanoid form. You would be able to see a bunch of lines coming off of it. Those are the connections it has to all the [[Infestators]] in the [[Drylands]]. A really strong creature with a weapon in it's right hand. It is as fast as a [[Loner]] and as strong as the [[Protector]], but it doesn't have their drawbacks. It's only weakness is the [[Artifact that will kill the Hive]].
