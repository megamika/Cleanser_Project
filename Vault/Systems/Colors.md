All the iteams in the game are going to have 4 colors. Primary, Secondary, Tertiary and highlights. The [[Equipment]] the [[Character]] will use will automatically become the color pallete of the [[Character]] who is weilding it. You will also be able to collect new color palletes and equip them on your character. Your color pallet will also be the same one used by your [[2nd Gen Cleaners]].
